# radXiFoam
CFD simulation solver with flamelet progress variable combustion model with radiation heat transfer.

## Overview
radXiFoam is an open source simulation tool for studying premixed flames. The solver is based on the XiFoam code developed by [OpenCFD Ltd.](http://openfoam.com/). 
The following models have been added.
* powerLaw (constant/combustionProperties/laminarFlameSpeedCorrelation)
* vaporInhomogeneousMixture (constant/thermophysicalProperties/mixture)
* radiation heat transfer

radXiFoam can be used for:
* premixed flame in confined/unconfined spaces 
* deflagration explosion

## Installation
- Unzip SRC.zip
- Source OpenFOAM v2112
- Execute "Allwmake.sh" to compile the solver and source codes

## Usage
radXiFoam takes inputs based on mass fraction.
The alphaBetaCalc.py tool allows the determination of the mass fraction of fuel (0/ft), water vapor (0/wv), nitrogen (0/n2), equivalence ratio  (constant/combustionProperties/equivalenceRatio), and alpha, beta (constant/combustionProperties/powerLawCoeffs).
The tutorial case and alphaBetaCalc.py are written based on the hydrogen flame.
