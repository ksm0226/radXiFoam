# radXiFoam
CFD simulation solver with flamelet progress variable combustion model.

## Overview
radXiFoam is an open source simulation tool for studying premixed flames. The solution is based on the XiFoam code developed by [OpenCFD Ltd.](http://openfoam.com/). 
radXiFoam can be used for:

* premixed flame in confined/unconfined spaces 
* deflagration explosion


## Installation
- Unzip SRC.zip
- Source OpenFOAM v2112
- Execute "Allwmake.sh" to compile the solver and source codes
